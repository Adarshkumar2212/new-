# Linear-Regression
Summary of the task: The repository contains python code used to train and build a machine learning model using simple linear regression. A small dataset was used consisting of two columns (height and weight). The data was first split into the training set and the test set; tools from the Scikit Learn Library were then used to build the main model. conclusion: There is a strong linear correlation between the heights and weights of the dataset in the form y=mx+c.  A model with high accuracy for predicting weights has been produced
